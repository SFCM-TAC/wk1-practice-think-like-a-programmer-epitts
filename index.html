    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>
    <div class="question">
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="answer">

      I would have multiple toggle button activated knobs that would react to midi input to stack triads above the notes, changing the third
      and fifth voice knob by half step based on the root note that is chosen or played.

    <br>
    <div class="question">
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="answer">

      I would write an app that mimics the piano. The object that I would use would be a
      recorded piano sample with a changing property like pitch. I would use
      an image of a regular piano. If one was to press a key, they would trigger an event
      called press, which then would trigger a method called Playpitch() with a variable
      corresponding to the button they pressed.
